# Hi There, IÂ´m Juan Esteban Calderon :thumbsup:

Based in Colombia :colombia:, I've been primarily working in the financial sector. I'm an enthusiastic software developer and a lifelong learner. I enjoy coding solutions for various business needs and currently, I'm focused on web development applications using Java and Python with SQL. Additionally, I'm actively learning about DevOps. It's amazing to see the endless possibilities that can be achieved with just a computer :desktop_computer:.
